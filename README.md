## Description

Traveling Salesman Problem: Implementation of an Optimization Algorithm based on Operational Research Techniques for Complexity Analysis

This study presents an analysis of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA). TSP is a classic optimization challenge, where the objective is to find the shortest route that visits every city once and returns to the starting city. The NNA algorithm is a heuristic approach with its main characteristic being its simplicity and efficiency in constructing an initial solution for the TSP, but it must be used with an understanding of its limitations, as it may not find the optimal solution in all cases.
